Power BI Learning Journey – Workout Wednesday Challenges
I have started exploring new Power BI skills by taking on random challenges from the Workout Wednesday website. For each challenge, I recreate the solution using sample datasets to deepen my understanding.

This repository contains my first completed challenge demonstrating the use of the Parameter tool in Power BI.

Numeric field parameter is used here to dynamically display the data label in an inventory value trend visual.

Additionally, I implemented a field parameter to allow dynamic selection of the Y-axis series by parts category. This lets the user choose to visualize any one of the inventory value, stockout incident counts, average holding cost, or inventory volume over the 12 months of 2024.

Using a field parameter, the X-axis can also be dynamically switched between part category and month-year.

These features showcase advanced interactive capabilities of Power BI for inventory analytics and reporting.
